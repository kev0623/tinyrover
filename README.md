A tiny rover software implementation

This is the official repository for the Software Sub-group in the Rover Robotics team. On a high level, 'Arduino' manipulates motor speed and direction control. 'Rover' deals with parsing raw GPS data and maintaining a server to send data to the rover.
This is especially important in autonomous. The 'user' deals with code for the controller (e.g., sensitivity) and sends it to the server for the rover.
